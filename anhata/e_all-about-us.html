                        All About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every human being has 7 chakras. In Sanskrit the heart chakra is called "Anahata"
                        This chakra is the centre of cosmic love.</p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time it is the balancing centre of the lower chakras (body centred chakras)
                        and the upper chakras (spiritual centred chakras). Often it is called the tip of
                        the scale. It is the compensatory centre. Human beings with an open heart chakra
                        as their focal point live in a balanced harmony, with love towards all that comes
                        up.</p>
                    <p>
                        The energies of the heart are love and pain. On that level it is necessary to be
                        conscious for own actions and also to become deeply sensitive in expressing feelings
                        and thoughts when talking to other souls.</p>
                    <p>
                        Anahata, the heart chakra, refers to the element air. Its colour is a soft bright
                        green and a tender rose colour.</p>
                    <p>
                        In our work for the people in Puttaparthi we would like to give a balancing reflection
                        of the heart and this means that we help with all our love. Our engagement for children
                        and old people will reflect in the generations with loving and caring actions in
                        the future also. Also in India the classical structures of large families are disappearing
                        more and more. This is the reason why we find much more old people and homeless
                        old people nowadays as a result of this change. In building a home for the old aged
                        people we want to give them a chance for a honourable end of their lifetime.</p>
                    <p>
                        Children are the future and children with a good education are a capital and support
                        for the future. In supporting schools, taking care that most of the children have
                        a birth-certificate (which is a necessity for further or higher education), we pay
                        for teachers, etc. We help, so that more children in rural districts can achieve
                        a school degree, in order to get a place for college and university studies also.</p>
                    <p>
                        An important aspect of our work is the "help yourself aspect" for the people. The
                        Organic Farm delivers vegetables and milk for the home for the aged and food for
                        the poor people from our own sources.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Tailoring School helps girls and women to learn sewing, so that they get into
                        the position to earn their own money to help their own family.</p>
