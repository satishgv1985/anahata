                        Social, Legal, Political and Economic Empowerment for Woman

                        The women Self Help Groups (SHGs) hold regular weekly meetings, save and repay regularly,
                        and use trained bookkeepers for proper bookkeeping. All SHG members abide by the
                        principles of saying no to child marriages, child labor, domestic violence and wasteful
                        expenditures.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px;">
                        The weekly meetings provide a platform for sharing and discussing broad social,
                        legal, political and economic issues that affect their lives. Issues range from
                        entitlements to land, access to NREGA and PDS, whether teachers and health workers
                        are actually doing the work allotted to them, and women's own rights in the case
                        of domestic violence.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px;">
                        The women discuss family planning, the number of children they should have, and
                        the spacing between births, indicating a significant change in their ability to
                        exercise reproductive choice within the household.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px;">
                        They have also not hesitated to take up difficult issues like domestic violence,
                        the trafficking of women and children, and the jogini system of exploitation.
