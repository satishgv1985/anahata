                        In olden days it was India which was growing food in the organic way. Now days,
                        because of the advancement of the technology and influence from the west and also
                        change in mindset of people who are running after fast money has totally changed
                        the organic farming scenario of India. Quite interestingly there are few more places
                        which are still going the organic way which is a good sign. In the ORGANIC FARMING-program
                        every care is taken by us to improve and encourage farmers in the surrounding villages
                        by educating them with Eco friendly and organic cultivation methods which are done
                        by us. In our DEMO-FARMS both sugar cane and vegetables are organically grown, which
                        will be used for the poor who are devoid of nutritious food.
