                            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px;">
                               Some of the families in Siddarampuram village, Anantapur (dist), Andhra Pradesh, take part in “FRIENDS”, our new Organization, intended to support women so that they can fulfill their basic needs. In this frame, they launched a village self motivated program, providing buffalos to selected poor people. By selling valuable milk they make a good income. The buffalo is a multipurpose animal: it also provides another natural source of energy! The cow dung fed to biogas pits will provide the women with a natural energy to cook. And the out residue waste from the biogas system can be converted to wormy compost which can be used for farming. As a very good side effect the alcoholic husbands give support wherever they can, for example by building grass shelters right in front of the main house for the Milk animals. Even the government of the village is so happy with this, that they wait impatiently for other projects, one of which could be solar streetlamps to provide permanent public safety through effective lighting of the streets. Indeed, the frequent and long power cuts are a big problem in India.

                                SAI MAA SOCIETY has twenty staff, out of this only two had their own account. Now eight more staff got own account what is used to transfer salary. By providing this system the staff also learns the way of spending the money. They also learn how to save the money for their families and their future.

                            <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px;">
                                Why Eco-clubs? The extent of the damage inflected on the environment by the ongoing pollution doesn’t need to be stressed. Eco-clubs are a small effort towards combating this situation.
<br/>
Each one of the two Eco-Club organizers from SAI MAA SOCIETY is supporting 20 Government schools and gives training in awareness of the environment. First they teach how to collect seeds and how to keep them. Read later what they will do next.   </p>
